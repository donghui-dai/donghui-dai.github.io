<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

This is Donghui Dai, a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Dr. Lei Yang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyanglei/#/pages/profile/about). My research focuses on mobile and sensing technologies for wireless security, backscatter communication, cyber-physical systems, and wireless sensing. I design algorithms and construct systems that connect, perceive, and interact with the environment in innovative ways to enable more efficient, secure, robust, and capable mobile systems. Currently, I focus on FPGA-based hardware/software co-design for RFID inventory systems. 

I have published several papers in top-tier avenues such as USENIX NSDI, ACM MobiCom, IEEE S&P, IEEE TMC, IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE PerCom. I have received awards including the Best Demo Award Runner-up at ACM MobiCom. I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world challenges in wireless communication and security.


<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision.
